# A Specality Products Web Application Project

I wanted to make something that can be used over and over again as a template for a web shop, so here I'll be using html, css, and javascript to the best of my ability to accomplish that task.

# A Way To Manage Web Shop Inventory

Within this web page, you'll be able to add individual items to a cart basket, remove them, update the quantity and learn a little more about the items themselves.
